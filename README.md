# DoomScan - Scrapyard Hackathon

## Overview

Do you catch your friends doomscrolling too often? Use this tool to put them in their place!

This project was built during the 2-day **Scrapyard Hackathon** as a fun experiment in combining live video processing with AI-powered humor. The app uses your device's camera to capture live footage, processes it into individual frames, and sends them via a Websocket to Google's experimental Gemini API. The goal was to have Gemini generate a humorous audio roast based on what it sees, specifically, to poke fun at social media habits like doom-scrolling. Although I managed to establish a connection and send data, Gemini never responded with the audio roast, so there’s more work to be done.

## Features

- **Live Camera Feed:**  
  Utilizes `react-native-vision-camera` to stream live video from the device's camera.
  
- **Frame Processing:**  
  Captures live frames, converts them to Base64 encoded JPEGs, and sends them over a WebSocket connection.
  
- **Experimental AI Integration:**  
  Attempts to leverage the experimental genAI library to connect to Gemini. The idea was to have Gemini process the incoming frames and return an audio roast tailored to the user's social media behavior.
  
- **Dynamic Audio Playback:**  
  Uses Expo's Audio API to play back any audio responses generated by Gemini (and also to play a meme sound on demand).

## The Reality:
   During the hackathon, while the connection was successfully established and data was sent, Gemini never responded with the audio roast. With more time, I would have:
   - Debugged the API interactions more thoroughly.
   - Tested the API endpoint manually instead of solely relying on the experimental library.
   - Added robust logging and error handling to better understand the issue.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and npm or yarn)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) installed globally
- A mobile device or simulator compatible with React Native

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arshansgithub/doomscan.git
   cd doomscan

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    yarn install

3. **Configure environment variables**
    Create a .env file in the project root with the following:
    ```env
    EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

4. **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    npx expo run:ios
    npx expo start
    

### Usage
1.	**Launch the App:**
    Open the app on your device or simulator.

2.	**Grant Permissions:**
    Allow camera and audio permissions when prompted.

3.	**Start Roasting:**
    Tap the “Start Roasting” button to activate the live camera feed and begin sending frames to Gemini.
4.	**Test Gemini and Audio:**
    Use the “Test Gemini” button to send a sample message, and tap “Test Sound” to play a custom meme sound.

### Lessons Learned

Working with bleeding-edge technology under a strict time limit was challenging. Although I established a connection with Gemini and transmitted data, the API never returned the expected audio roast. It didn't return anything! This experience underscored the importance of:
* Allocating more time for debugging and manual API testing.
* Building robust error handling and logging when working with experimental libraries.
* Being flexible with creative ideas during a hackathon environment.
